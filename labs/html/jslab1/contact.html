For each prompt if user input valid show him next prompt, if not valid show him the same prompt again until user enters it correctly (use loops). And after validating user input, write all user input on the page in that format:

            "use strict";
            while(true){
                var name =prompt("enter your name");
                if(typeof name === "string"){
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            while(true){
                var birthyear = parseInt(prompt("enter your birth year"));
                if(!isNaN(birthyear) && birthyear < 2010){
                    break;
                }
                else{
                    alert("Invalid birth year");
                }
            }
            var age = 2025 - birthyear;
            document.write("Name: " + name + "<br><br>");
            document.write("Birth year: " + birthyear + "<br><br>");
